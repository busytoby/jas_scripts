these scripts mostly for previewing media/organizing collections

randfile.pl - choose a random line from stdin
randplay2.sh - play a random video from the current directory, prompting for what to do at end
mplay2.sh - play 4 or 6 random videos simultaneously from within the current subtree
sync-ipod.sh - self explanatory
